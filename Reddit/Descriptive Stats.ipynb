In physics, the variational principle can be something like \"light rays minimize total travel time\" or \"the equilibrium configuration minimizes total energy\" or something similar. These are much more general principles that can be used to find the solution rather than having to come up with the differential equations directly.\n",

In classical mechanics, for instance, it's a lot easier to simply set up some coordinate system, write down the kinetic energy and potential energy, and then write down L = T - U... rather than trying to figure out the proper form of the forces in your coordinate system. The nice thing about Lagrangians in classical mechanics is that you can really choose whatever coordinates you want, calculate L, and then just out pops the EL-equations. You're not limited to, say, Cartesian coordinates, which, while easier for finding forces directly, may not actually be a very useful coordinate system for your problem.\n",

Physically, this is also really, really good because we can easily derive conservation laws that may not have been apparent, and we also have a more fundamental reason for such conservation laws in the first place.\n",

If we knew **x**(t) (from t = 0 to t = 1), the true path of the particle, then *S* would be the integral of T - U along the path of the particle from t = 0 to t = 1. The point here is that the action *S* in general problems need not have any useful meaning. It's just the integral of some Lagrangian *L* which leads to some set of equations, the solution to which is the desired minimizing function or path. (Of course, in the very first example I wrote above, *S* was arc length, and so, in that case, *S* *did* have a meaningful interpretation.

The standard method of solving the HJ-equation is by the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are precisely the *Hamiltonian equations* also learned in a typical mechanics course.)\n",

When you move on to more advanced physics, like classical electromagnetism or special relativity, it's immediately unclear whether the relevant equations of motion can be derived from a Lagrangian. For instance, in classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force law is not derivable from a potential. So there's some reason to suspect whether you can even come up with a Lagrangian that works. (Spoiler alert: there *is* a Lagrangian that works, which means the associated EL-equations are just Newton's second law with the Lorentz force law. Maxwell's equations are taken as supplementary.) The same thing happens in special relativity. Newton's second law is no longer of the same form, so why should there be a Lagrangian? Well, there *is*. However, neither the Lagrangian in classical electrogmagnetism nor the Lagrangian in special relativity is equal to T - U, as it is in classical mechanics.

In this case, yes the energy cost should be higher for plasmids for 2 main reasons. \n",

      "The first is the plasmid itself. There is more DNA than just the gene, so replicating all of that takes more energy and just as importantly, more time. In addition, ATP or redox energy is not the only limiting thing in the cell. Having plasmids that are expressing genes and replicating takes up transcription factors, polymerases, operators, etc. which could be needed elsewhere, resulting in delays in general function. In an environment where the fastest grower wins, this can be quite serious.\n",

      "The second thing that is important, at least within the realm of plasmids used in biotechnology is that often we when we add genes on plasmids, we want quite a bit of the gene product around.

So on top of all the extra stuff on a given plasmid molecule, if you have 100 copies of a 10kb plasmid, then your total plasmid DNA is not too far off the size of the genome.

In the earliest moments of the universe, it is hypothesized that (and there is some indirect evidence for) the universe was expanding extremely rapidly for an extremely short time -- this bout of expansion is called [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)).  Inflation is thought to last for just the tiniest fraction of a blink of an eye, during which time the universe's scale factor increases by a factor of about 10^(25) (which means the volume of any bounded region increases by a factor of 10^(75)).  This period of extreme expansion is believed to magnify the tiniest quantum fluctuations in the gravitational field into much larger-scale fluctuations, which become the seeds for the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes.\n",

      "After inflation ends, the universe is filled with a quark-gluon plasma, and continues expanding but muuuuch slower.  While inflation is believed to happen in a tiny fraction of a second, it takes dozens of seconds to minutes before the universe expands and cools enough for [nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis) to \"freeze out\" of the quark-gluon plasma, and then another several hundred thousand years before the universe has expanded and cooled enough for those nuclei to [capture electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)) and become atoms.  When the nuclei and atoms combine to form neutral hydrogen and helium, the universe goes from being filled with a charged plasma that is opaque to being filled with a neutral gas which is transparent, so photons largely decouple from matter and are suddenly free to travel through space unimpeded -- these decoupled photons are the origin of the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background).  When this decoupling happens, these photons were around 4000K temperature.  Since that time, the universe has continued expanding and cooling, and today the CMB has a temperature of less than 3K.\n",

But my ziplocked half eaten sandwich is in my backpack which goes through an airport x-ray machine. Would the x-ray kill all the bacteria on the sandwich thereby effectively irradiating it to be safe again?\n",

      "\u001b[31m----\u001b[0m That doesn’t make much sense. For one thing, the word “deformed” implies that an American dialect itself is unnatural in some way, as if there is a natural state of the palate with which British English is compatible, but which American English alters over time. That is a load of hooey for multiple reasons, but here are a few. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Dialects evolve and change over time. American and British dialects are the same age, because they were diverted at the same time. They share a recent ancestor, but you’ll find as much in common and as much different when you compare either one to, say, Chaucer. One is not a degradation of the other, they are both heritors of an older English. That dispels the idea that the American dialect would cause “deformation” from a natural, ie British, state.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. As for whether phonemic inventory affects palate morphology: probably not. Humans are born capable of distinguishing between phonemes in any language, including those that don’t exist in their parents’ spoken tongues. As they age, children lose sensitivity to phonemes outside of their inventory, as well as the motor skills to create them, and the brain reallocates space toward more relevant tasks. This is, for example, why Japanese speakers of English typically have trouble producing distinct “r” and “l” consonants, or may pronounce the middle consonants in “measure” and “major” the same. (Apologies for not being more specific, but I don’t have access to proper IPA characters and don’t want to trouble with copy pasting them.) (Also, FYI, my linguistics mentor is Japanese; this is coming straight from the source and is backed by data, not personal experience in case anyone assumes I’m just employing racial stereotypes to prove my point.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Anywho, the long short of it is that the language you speak DOES influence the sounds you are able to produce, but evidence suggests that the origin of this is in the frontal lobe (language center of the brain), not in the mouth. Furthermore, this phenomenon has zero relevance to the described scene; there is only one language in play (English), and mere accents are not known to have influence over something as major as phonemic inventory. Case in point: Americans can do an English accent, and English folks can do an American one. So while the scenario you presented is tangentially related to known linguistic phenomena, in the end, it’s just a plot device.\n",
